- ðŸ•³ supports react-portals

# Usage
Just wrap content, which should be scrollable, and everything else would not.

## More than one lock
This library will silence any scroll(wheel, touch) event outside of whitelisted node. To be able to use more than one lock:
- disable isolation mode `<RemoveScroll noIsolation />`. Then remove scroll would handle only events, happened inside it.
To use this mode you have to _cast_ some _shadow_ behind a modal, to redirect all events to your element
- use [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky), or [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on), but they are lager. 

# Size
1.5kb after compression (excluding tslib).

# Scroll-Locky
This is a refactoring of another library - [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky) -
to make package smaller and more react-portals friendly.
